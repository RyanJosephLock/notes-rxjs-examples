// Create promise that resolves after 1 second
// This replicates a http requrest or other async operation

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('resolved!')
    }, 1000)
})


// Convert the promise into an observable
// This is useful when working with a javascript library that is built on promises

const obsvPromise = Rx.Observable.fromPromise(promise)

// Subscribe and print the promise result via the Observable

obsvPromise.subscribe(result => print(result) )

// Note: it's also possible to convert an Observable into a promise by using toPromise()
